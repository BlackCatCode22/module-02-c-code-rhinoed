## Submit your Module 02 work here

Use this remote repo to submit all code in Module 02.

## Requirements

1. `reversedStrings.cpp` - You will create a simple program that takes a user's input string and reverses it. For example, if the user inputs "hello", the program will output "olleh".

2. `funWithFunctions.cpp` - You will explore the use of functions in C++. You will create a program that involves three distinct functions: `getAnIntFromTheUser`, `compareTwoInts`, and `sumTwoInts`. The program will demonstrate how functions can be used to break down a problem into smaller, manageable parts.

3. `largestOfThree.cpp` - This program, titled "largestOfThree.cpp," is designed to help you understand conditional statements in C++. Your task is to write a program that asks the user for three integers, determines the largest among them using nested if statements, and outputs the largest integer.
